==== Operations ====
* Creating a singly linked list
  creating a singly linked list (10-50)
  create a singly linked list from an array int[]
* Length of Linked List - Counts the number of nodes in linked list 
* Print Linked List - Traversal of a linked list or print a given linked list
* Search in a Linked List
* Linked List Insertion - insert in a given linked list
- beginning(before the head),
- end(after the tail) and
- middle (random location, after some node based on value)
* Deleting a node in a linked list - delete a node in a given linked list
- first node(before the head),
- last node(after the tail) and
- middle (random location, after some node based on value)
* Delete a Linked List
* Nth Node from Start
* Nth Node from End
* Size of Doubly Linked List


==== Easy Problems ====

* Remove every k-th node
* Middle of a Linked List
* Count Occurrences in a Linked List
* Circular Linked List Traversal
* Check if Circular
* Count Nodes in Circular List
* Deletion from a Circular Linked List
* Singly to circular Conversion
* Exchange first and last nodes in Circular
* Delete in a Doubly Linked List
* Reverse a Singly Linked List
* Reverse a Doubly Linked List
